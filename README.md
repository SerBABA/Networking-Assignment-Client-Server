# Networking-Assignment-Client-Server 10/11/2020

This was a assignment involving the development of a Server and Client, which both only included a single
function of handling a request for the current time/date in one of three langauges (Maori, English and German).
This involved using sockets and communicating over the UDP protocol.

To run the project:
1. run `python3 client.py`
2. run `python3 server.py`
